# Freiburg-Paris-All-Night-Long

(The name of this working data repository, reminding of the [famous movie by Mika K.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Napoli_All_Night_Long) is no coincidence.)

This repository is used as a project-internal collaborative platform to work with different kinds of preprocessed corpus data from different languages investigated by [The Freiburg Research Group in Saami Studies](http://www.skandinavistik.uni-freiburg.de/institut/forschung/forschungsprojekte/saami) in collaboration with [Laboratoire LaTTiCe](http://www.lattice.cnrs.fr) and other partners.

Whereas the access to the data is open in principle, we intend to use this repository exclusively for our own work-in-project. Therefore, no metadata or other general documentation explaining these data is needed.
