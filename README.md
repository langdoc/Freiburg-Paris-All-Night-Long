# Freiburg-Paris-All-Night-Long

(The name, reminding of the [famous movie by Mika K.](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki-Napoli_%E2%80%93_All_Night_Long), is no coincidence.)

This repository is used as a project-internal collaborative platform to work with various kinds of preprocessed corpus data from the different languages investigated by [The Freiburg Research Group in Saami Studies](http://www.skandinavistik.uni-freiburg.de/institut/forschung/forschungsprojekte/saami) in collaboration with [Laboratoire LaTTiCe](http://www.lattice.cnrs.fr) and other partners.

Whereas the access is completely open in principle, we intend to use this repository exclusively for our own work-in-project. Therefore, no metadata or other general documentation explaining these data is needed.
